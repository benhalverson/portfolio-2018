        I worked on various B2B websites and mobile applications that are used
          for:

          <ol>
            <li>

            B2B sales from medical companies to medical doctors and hospitals.

            </li>
            <li>
            <p>
            For medical doctors to train other doctors on procedures and

          My focus was to implement the user interface designs on tablets,
          laptops and browser based applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology used: HTML, CSS, Typescript, Angular, React, React Native,
          Bootstrap, SCSS, Grunt, Node.js
        </p>
        <strong>Special conditions:</strong>
        <p>
          Because these are high priced medical institutions, the UX and the
          application needed to run near perfectly with very high attention to
          detail.
        </p>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li><p>
            These applications contained specific medical and drug
              information, which requires following strict Federal regulations.
              The FDA prior to release inspected all finished applications.
            </p>
              
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
              Very short deadlines that could not be missed because of big
              product launches after drug approval by the FDA.
